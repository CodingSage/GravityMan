## NO WAY UP 

A puzzle/shooter platformer where the player assumes the role of John Flipman, a gun slinging space age civilian who is tracking down the people who stole his wallet (or ate his lunch). Using his trusty gravity boots, Flipman is able to manipulate his own gravity and use any surface as his floor. The player can also change the gravity of some special objects which exist in the environment. Enemies and other entities (machines, robots) can also have the same power as Flipman, because technology can't choose.

*Title and storyline subject to change to maybe make more sense, but no promises*

Powerups 
- If gravity change recharge time is present, we can reduce the recharge time
- Jump bonus
- Armour
- Weapons
- Control a mecha

Environment
- Environment is starting off in a city with an obvious right way up. Eventually we want to design environments where its not obvious anymore. Navigating such environments and solving puzzles should be core to the game.
