## Gravity Man

GravityMan is a platformer where you play a thief who has the ability to control the direction of their own gravity and that of some special objects in the environment. Using this power the player has to solve puzzles, navigate and avoid/fight enemies (guards) to break into vaults and steal items. Emphasis on stealth, fighting/killing will make the player lose points.
