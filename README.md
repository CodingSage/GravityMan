## NO WAY UP 

Shooter in space/futuristic environment. Player navigates the environment using gravity boots which enables the player to treat any surface as his floor. The player can also change the gravity for some special objects in the environment. Other enemies/entities are also capable of changing their own gravity and that of other objects similar to the player.

Storyline: TBD

Powerups 
- If gravity change recharge time is present, we can reduce the recharge time
- Jump bonus
- Armour
- Weapons
- Control a mecha

Environment
- Environment is starting off in a city with an obvious right way up. Eventually we want to design environments where its not obvious anymore. Navigating such environments and solving puzzles should be core to the game.
